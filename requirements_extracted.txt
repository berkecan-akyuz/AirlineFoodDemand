Airline Food Demand Prediction 
1. Problem Description 
Airlines face a critical challenge in determining the optimal amount of food to load for each 
flight. Loading too much results in food waste and increased fuel costs due to extra weight. 
Loading too little leads to passenger dissatisfaction and complaints. Traditional methods rely 
on fixed ratios that fail to account for dynamic factors such as flight duration, pa ssenger 
demographics, and travel patterns. 
Your task is to develop a machine learning solution that predicts the total food demand for a 
given flight based on various flight and passenger characteristics. This prediction will help 
airlines optimize their catering operations, reduce waste, and improve customer satisfaction. 
Business Impact: Optimizing in -flight catering can lead to significant cost savings and 
reduced food waste, while simultaneously improving passenger satisfaction. 
2. Dataset Requirements 
You will create a synthetic dataset that simulates real airline flight data. The dataset must 
contain at least 5,000 flight records with the following features: 
Definition: One "food unit" represents one meal or snack package prepared for a 
passenger. 
Feature Type Description 
flight_id Integer Unique flight identifier 
flight_duration Float Flight duration in hours (1-12) 
passenger_count Integer Total number of passengers (50-300) 
adult_passengers Integer Number of adult passengers 
child_passengers Integer Number of child passengers 
business_class_ratio Float Ratio of business class passengers (0-1) 
is_international Binary (0/1) Whether the flight is international 
total_food_demand Integer TARGET VARIABLE - Total food units 
needed

⚠️ Important: flight_id is an identifier only. It must NOT be used as a predictive feature in 
your models. 
2.1 Data Validation Rules 
Your synthetic dataset must satisfy all of the following logical constraints. Datasets that 
violate these rules will receive point deductions: 
# Validation Rule 
1 adult_passengers + child_passengers == passenger_count 
2 0 <= business_class_ratio <= 1 
3 1 <= flight_duration <= 12 (realistic flight duration range) 
4 if is_international == 1 then flight_duration >= 3 
5 50 <= passenger_count <= 300 
6 total_food_demand >= passenger_count * 0.5 
7 Dataset must contain at least 5,000 rows 
8 is_international == 1 for at least 15% of flights (data diversity) 
9 flight_duration must include both short (1-3h) and long (8-12h) flights 
 
2.2 Target Variable Requirements 
Critical Requirement: Your total_food_demand must depend on at least 3 different features 
(e.g., passenger_count, flight_duration, and is_international or business_class_ratio). Simply 
multiplying passenger_count by a constant is not acceptable. Your report must explain what 
relationships you embedded in the target variable. 
3. Project Tasks 
Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (20 points) 
Perform a comprehensive analysis of your dataset to understand the underlying patterns 
and relationships: 
• Display basic statistics using descriptive methods 
• Check for missing values and handle them appropriately 
• Create a correlation heatmap to identify feature relationships 
• Visualize distributions using histograms and boxplots 
• Create scatter plots to examine relationships with the target variable 
Task 2: Baseline Model (10 points)

Before building any machine learning model, establish a baseline for comparison. The 
baseline helps you understand whether your ML models are actually learn ing meaningful 
patterns. 
Baseline Strategy: Use the mean of the training set as the prediction for all test samples 
(Mean Predictor). Calculate R², MAE, and RMSE for this baseline. 
Why is this important? If your ML model cannot beat this simple baseline, it indicates that 
the model has not learned useful patterns from the data. 
Task 3: Linear Regression Model (15 points) 
Implement a Linear Regression model as your first machine learning approach: 
1. Split your data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets 
2. Train a Linear Regression model on the training data 
3. Make predictions on the test set 
4. Calculate performance metrics: R², MAE, RMSE 
5. Create a scatter plot comparing actual vs. predicted values 
Task 4: Alternative Model of Your Choice (30 points) 
Select and implement a second regression model to compare against Linear Regression. 
You may choose from models such as: 
• Random Forest Regressor 
• Gradient Boosting Regressor 
• XGBoost  
• Support Vector Regressor 
• Decision Tree Regressor 
Required: You must justify your  model choice. Explain why you selected this particular 
algorithm and what advantages it might offer for this problem. 
If you choose a tree -based model, include a feature importance analysis showing which 
features contribute most to the predictions. 
Task 5: Model Comparison & Error Analysis (10 points) 
Create a comprehensive comparison of all three approaches (Baseline, Linear Regression, 
and your chosen model): 
• Present a comparison table with R², MAE, and RMSE for each model 
• Discuss which model performs best and explain why 
• Analyze the trade-offs between model complexity and performance 
• Include a residual plot or error histogram showing the distribution of prediction 
errors for your best model
